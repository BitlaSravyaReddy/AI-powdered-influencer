# AI-Powdered Influencer 🎥🤖

## Overview

**AI-Powdered Influencer** is a voice-driven browser automation system that acts like a human YouTuber reviewing new tech products on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze product pages, navigate their UI, explore navigation bars, and then **speak natural-sounding reviews** using TTS. All browser activity is automated using Brave via Playwright.

This project is ideal for creating automated review content or testing the UX of product websites.

## Model Evaluation Insights


According to our internal research, various open-source local LLMs were tested to automate and narrate browser sessions. However, most models failed to fully comprehend or execute the multi-step interaction flow. Here's a summary:

| Model Name              | Observation / Limitation                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DeepSeek Coder 6.7B** | Hallucinates frequently; unsuitable for reliable use          |
| **LLaMA 3.1 7B**        | Gets stuck in search bar loop; poor browser understanding     |
| **Qwen2 7B**            | Inconsistent task performance                                 |
| **Yi 9B**               | Loops on `example.com` tab; blank navigation issues           |
| **LLaMA (Groq)**        | Unable to maintain logical navigation                         |
| **Mistral (latest)**    | Fails to understand task; stuck in infinite loop              |
| **Qwen 2.5 14B**        | Best among local models; still slow and occasionally confused |

✅ Conclusion: Cloud-based models like Gemini 2.0 Flash / 2.5 Flash offer superior task comprehension and contextual consistency, making them more suitable for this browser automation task.
